The Class Routine Management System project is designed to revolutionize the academic experience at our institution. In an era of dynamic academic schedules, our system offers a robust solution that caters to the diverse needs of students and teachers. It empowers students to access information about academic vacations, permanent and updated class routines, and receive real-time notifications about any changes in their schedules. Additionally, the system offers detailed subject and teacher information, creating a comprehensive academic resource hub. For teachers, the system provides administrative capabilities, enabling them to customize and manage their schedules effectively. It also offers features like class time updates, conflict alerts, and seamless communication with students. By streamlining this process, the Class Routine Management System aims to enhance academic efficiency and ensure that students and teachers have the tools they need for a productive and organized educational experience.                                                                                                                                      

The Class Routine Management System is built upon a robust technological foundation, leveraging various technologies to create an efficient and user-friendly platform. The system's front-end is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing an intuitive and visually appealing user interface. It offers a seamless experience for students and teachers, facilitating easy navigation and interaction. The back end of the system is powered by MySQL, a reliable relational database management system, ensuring data integrity and efficient data storage and retrieval. PHP serves as the server-side scripting language, handling dynamic content generation and communication between the user interface and the database. Additionally, the project employs the Bootstrap framework, which streamlines responsive web design and enhances the system's accessibility on various devices. This technological stack, combined with user-specific features and functionalities, contributes to the project's success in managing class routines and schedules effectively.
